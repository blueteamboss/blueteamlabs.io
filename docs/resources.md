## Log Solutions and SIEM
### Splunk
Splunk has the Splunk Developer program, which gives you a renewable 6-month Enterprise license

* 10GB/ingest a day
* Full Enterprise Usability
* Can deploy multiple servers

[Register for Splunk Developer](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/dev_license/)

Splunk may require you to prove developer usage, but in talking with Splunk reps (we invested heavily in Splunk as work) this is fairly lenient. I do have some concerns about how this changes under Cisco's leadership. Cisco does have a tendency to switch things up for no particular reason.

### Graylog
Graylog is one I've personally used in the past. It used to be called Graylog community, but is now Graylog open. It's a fantastic started log management/SIEM solution that atleast used to have alot of good pre-built security focused dashboards.
It's free and unlimited ingest.
