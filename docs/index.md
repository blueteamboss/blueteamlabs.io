# Welcome to BLUE TEAM LABS

Hey folks, welcome to BLUE TEAM LABS. Here' you'll find a collection of documentation, blog posts, and other useful media.

BLUE TEAM LABS and BLUE TEAM JAMES are my contribution to growing the security community and expanding our knowledge base. This is an effort too document my homelab and it's journey to become greater than most enterprise networks in terms of security, my journey in Cyber, blogs, and more. I hope you enjoy the content.

# How to use this site

## [Blog](blog/index.md)
My thoughts and prayers go here. They probably fall on deaf ears, but it's okay. This will be specific problems I solve as I encounter them, thoughts on trending topics, guidance for critical security vulnerabilities or incidents, and more.

???+danger "Disclaimer"
    This should be obvious, but the opinions, expressions, and content on this site or shared by the BLUE TEAM LABS/BLUE TEAM JAMES platform are not represtative of my employer. They are wholly my own and are not made in consultation with any current or previous employer.

## [Lab Architecture](arch/index.md)
All of the documentation for my homelab. I'm making it as open as possible. This is something I usually wouldn't recommend for any business or organization, but one that I think the benefits outweight the risk when discussing how it can help others. Maybe they're interested in exactly how I'm implementing one control or the options I would recommend, and maybe they want to follow along as I do videos and blogs discussing the journey.

The Lab Architecture section will cover details on my design and implementation for:

* Virtualization
* Segmentation
* Identity and Access Management
* Endpoint Security 
* Network Monitoring
* Log Management
* Remote Access
* Multi-Factor Authentication
* Active Directory
* Certificate Authorities

...and so much more.

This is just getting started and it'll start out pretty bare. As much as I would love to site here for two weeks straight and document everything in one go, I have a day job and family that I need to tend to. 

## [Resources](resources.md)
This is an empty section right now, but this will be the golden secret. This is where you'll find every resource you could possibly need on:
* Lab Licensing
* Developer Licensing
* Downloading Evaluation Software
* Discounts and Sales

It'll also have a comprehensive list of utilities and tools, and perhaps a detailed list of respectable vendors that you might want to use in your day job. I've used alot of the tools and solutions out there, and might have some guidance on which ones would be best for your organization. Obviously, you'll have to see for yourself, but it's a good starting point.
