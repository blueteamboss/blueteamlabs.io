# Saying Goodbye to Github Pages
I originally set this github pages site up about 2-weeks ago and have iterated through a few different configurations. Despite this, othing really woorks as it's expected and it's quite obnoxious.

My site is verified and there's some annoying bug with Github pages where the custom domain name you set up get removed if you're using a custom Github action. Perhaps this is some weird setting with me using mkdocs, but it's getting on my nerves.

Despite my domain being verified, I continuously get a certificate warning when attempting to visit the site. This is both unnaceptable, and obnoxious.

I'll blame myself, perhaps I fucked something up somewhere along the way, but I'm done fidgeting with it because it works right one day, only to be fucked another.

I'll be migrating things to Cloudflare pages, despite my best judgement. I do not approve of how Cloudflare has handled billing and content moderation issues in the past, and they've got a history of just dooing shady shit. 

I'll write some posts on this if theres anything interesting. For now, goodbye Github pages. Perhaps even, I will go back to Gitlab out of spite.
